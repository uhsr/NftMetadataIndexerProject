# NftMetadataIndexerProject

## Description

A decentralized NFT marketplace leveraging off-chain IPFS storage and on-chain fractional ownership via ERC-1155 tokens, enhanced with a Merkle tree-based royalty distribution system for gas-efficient payouts to multiple creators.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata from multiple EVM-compatible chains using RPC endpoints and event listeners.
- Persists indexed metadata in a PostgreSQL database with optimized schemas for efficient querying.
- Exposes a GraphQL API for flexible and performant retrieval of NFT metadata based on various filters.
- Implements a caching layer using Redis to minimize database load and improve API response times.
- Utilizes a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous processing of NFT transfer events.
- Deploys a serverless function on AWS Lambda to validate and sanitize NFT metadata before indexing.
- Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the indexer and performing administrative tasks.
- Integrates with IPFS gateways to resolve decentralized metadata URIs and store the resolved data.
